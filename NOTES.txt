why does the game take so long to start after I reboot?
* subsequent runs are fast

.insert_resource(ReportExecutionOrderAmbiguities::default()) shows us parallel
systems.

When two parallel systems access the same mutable resource, we have a data race.

Two parallel systems whose "inputs" and "outputs" overlap may indicate that a
third common system should exist.

If something's only happening in one place there should probably only be one system
for it. e.g. button presses - there is conceptually a single stream of button presses,
so there should be a single system that generates button press events. Then everything
that needs to respond to button presses reads from this stream.
